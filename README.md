# spelling-checker-assignment-31251
Spellchecker program written in C++ that checks the contents of a text file for words that don't exist within a given dictionary. Arguments for the dictionary file and text file must be given in that order.
It will then print out the words that aren't found within the dictionary through a cout stream.
